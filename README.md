# Wild Blueberry Yield Prediction

## Introduction
This notebook is part of the "Prediction of Wild Blueberry Yield" competition, which aims to develop a predictive model for wild blueberry yield based on various environmental, pollination, climate, and berry-related characteristics. The goal is to create a model that can accurately predict the yield of wild blueberries, providing valuable insights for farmers and scientists.

## Dataset
The dataset provided contains the following features:

- `id`: Unique identifier for each observation.
- `clonesize`: Size of the blueberry plant clones.
- `honeybee`, `bumbles`, `andrena`, `osmia`: Different species of bees and their presence in the growing area.
- `MaxOfUpperTRange`, `MinOfUpperTRange`, `AverageOfUpperTRange`, `MaxOfLowerTRange`, `MinOfLowerTRange`, `AverageOfLowerTRange`: Different aspects of temperature range in the growing area.
- `RainingDays`, `AverageRainingDays`: Number of rainy days and average rainy days in the growing area.
- `fruitset`, `fruitmass`, `seeds`: Different aspects of blueberry fruits, including fruit production per plant, fruit mass, and number of seeds per fruit.
- `yield`: The target variable representing the yield of wild blueberries per unit of land.

## Methodology
The following steps will be performed (ongoing) to tackle the challenge of predicting wild blueberry yield:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Comprehensive analysis to understand the nature of the data.
2. Data Preprocessing: Based on the findings from EDA, necessary data preprocessing steps will be applied, including handling missing values, transforming features, and removing outliers if deemed appropriate.
3. Feature Engineering: Creation of new features from existing ones to enhance the model's performance. This may involve combining related features or creating interaction features to capture relationships between existing features.
4. Model Selection: Testing various machine learning models to identify the most promising model type for this problem.
5. Hyperparameter Optimization: Once the model is selected, optimizing its hyperparameters to maximize performance.
6. Model Evaluation: Finally, evaluating the performance of the model.

## Dependencies
This notebook requires the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- IPython
- sklearn
- xgboost
- lightgbm

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```pip install pandas numpy IPython sklearn xgboost lightgbm```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the notebook file (`PredictionOfWildBlueberryYield.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to reproduce the analysis and predictions.
4. Customize the notebook as needed for your own analysis.
